<h2>OTHER PRACTICAL INFORMATION</h2>
    
<h3>1) Tickets:</h3>
<p>All speakers receive a free ticket for the conference which will be sent out in a later email. This includes the workshop day prior to the conference. Please note that you need to register for workshops in August just as any regular ticket holder if you want to participate.</p>
    
<h3>2) Reimbursements:</h3>
<p>Being a speaker at JavaZone does not automatically make you eligible for reimbursement. Instead, you have to apply for reimbursement. Please see https://2019.javazone.no/speakers/monetary-policy for information about how you can apply. Please note that we do not provide reimbursement to lightning-talk speakers.</p>

<h3>3) JourneyZone:</h3>
<p>JourneyZone is open to all speakers and is a fantastic chance to experience the nature of Norway and make new friends! JourneyZone will be held the weekend after the conference, but at this time, we are not ready to hand out information. We will contact you once the details are confirmed.</p>

<h3>4) Speakers dinner:</h3>
<p>As always, we'll be hosting a speakers dinner the evening before JavaZone. You can expect more information about this in August.</p>
