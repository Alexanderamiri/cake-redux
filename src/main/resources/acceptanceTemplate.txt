OTHER PRACTICAL INFORMATION
-----------------------------------

1) Reimbursements:
Being a speaker at JavaZone does not automatically make you eligible for reimbursement. Instead, you have to apply for reimbursement. Please see https://2019.javazone.no/speakers/monetary-policy for information about how you can apply.

2) JourneyZone:
JourneyZone is open to all speakers and is a fantastic chance to experience the nature of Norway and make new friends! JourneyZone will be held the weekend after the conference, but at this time, we are not ready to hand out information. We will contact you once the details are confirmed.

3) Speakers dinner:
As always we'll be hosting a speakers dinner the evening before JavaZone. You can expect more information about this in August.

For more information see: http://2019.javazone.no/speakers

If you have any more questions, reply to this email. Please be aware that the response time on emails during the summer holidays (in July) will be longer than normal.

If you have any questions regarding the conference, please feel free to contact the Program Committee at program@java.no.
